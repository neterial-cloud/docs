## Generating an API token

To generate an API token on your [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/), please open your project and do the following:

1. Go to **Security** on the left menu bar

4. Create your API token

- Enter a description in the upper text box.

- Choose a permission. You can choose between **Read** and **Read & Write**.

  If you select **Read**, the token will only be allowed to perform GET requests.

  If you select **Read & Write**, the token will be allowed to perform GET, DELETE, PUT and POST requests.

5. Copy your API token

You now have an API token. Note that it is not possible to view the token again once the window has been closed.

**Please note:** Your secret API token has to be included in **every request** you send to the API.

Example [curl](https://curl.se/):

```
curl \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    ...
```
