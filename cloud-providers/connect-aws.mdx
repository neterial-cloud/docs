## Generating an API tokens

1. Open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and sign in using your root user credentials. For instructions, see [Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial.html) in the *AWS Sign-In User Guide*.
2. In the upper right corner of the console, choose your account name or number and then choose **Security Credentials**.
3. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**. If this option is not available, then you already have the maximum  number of access keys. You must delete one of the existing access keys  before you can create a new key. For more information, see [IAM Object Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entities).
4. On the **Alternatives to root user access keys** page, review the security recommendations. To continue, select the checkbox, and then choose **Create access key**.
5. On the **Retrieve access key** page, your **Access key** ID is displayed.
6. Under **Secret access key**, choose **Show** and then copy the access key ID and secret key from your browser window and paste it somewhere secure. Alternatively, you can choose **Download .csv file** which will download a file named `rootkey.csv` that contains the access key ID and the secret key. Save the file somewhere safe.
7. Choose **Done**. When you no longer need the access key [we recommend that you delete it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user_manage_delete-key.html), or at least consider deactivating it so that no one can misuse it.
