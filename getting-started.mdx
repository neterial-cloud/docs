title: 'Getting Started'
description: 'This guide will take you from initial registration to a running Kubernetes cluster using the CLI. You can also do this in the UI [web console](https://console.neterial.io)'
---

## 1. Sign up for Neterial

Install CLI:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.neterial.io/cli.sh | bash
```

Sign up and log in with the Neterial CLI:

```sh
neterial auth login
```

## 2. Connect your cloud

Neterial installs and manages resources in your cloud account and requires access credentials for your chosen provider.

Choose one of the following cloud providers:
* [Connect Hetzner Cloud](cloud-providers/connect-hetzner-cloud)
* [Connect AWS cloud](cloud-providers/connect-aws)

Each guide will walk you through the necessary permissions and authentication setup.

Verify that the cloud is connected:

```sh
neterial provider list
```

Example output:
```console
NAME            STATUS          LAST_UPDATE
AWS             Uninitialized
Hetzner Cloud   Ready           2 seconds
```

## 3. Create the cluster

Create a Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```sh
neterial kube create cluster --cloud [PROVIDER]
```

Replace:
- `PROVIDER` with either `hcloud` (for Hetzner Cloud) or `aws` (for AWS)

Verify that your cluster was created successfully:

```sh
neterial kube get clusters
```

Example output:
```console
NAME      STATUS   PROVIDER        LOCATION   AGE          VERSION
default   Ready    Hetzner Cloud   hel1       5 minutes    1.32
```

## 4. Get access to the cluster

```sh
kubectl config use-context default-neterial-admin@default-neterial
kubectl get nodes
```

Verify that you can access your cluster:

```sh
kubectl get nodes
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
nks-default-ctl-1d39beb8   Ready    control-plane   9m39s   v1.32.3
nks-default-wrk-5a451893   Ready    <none>          8m35s   v1.32.3
```

Congratulations! You now have a fully operational Kubernetes cluster managed by Neterial.

## Next step

Now that your cluster is running, you can **[Deploy Your First App](guides/deploy-your-first-app)**.
